## About this project

I have created this guide to help me to see if colours and/or fonts match together well before I go and create a live project layout, where I apply the chosen theme to it. 

I am happy to share this guide with others (that would be you!), and I hope this will be considered to be helpful. However, I am aware that not all of you have in-depth design knowledge, and I am talking about the fine details such as letter spacing, line height, font weight and more.

### Usage

When you go through this, you will see properties being commented out. But, I have put them there, hoping it will give you ideas and play around with them too. While I do understand that you may not know this, but even smaller details does actually make a different to what font or you have chosen.

I also added animation effect for a smooth transition of comparison of different styles (it was not necessary). However, bear in mind not all properties (like font-family) work with animation, but it will still change to the specific style once hovered over.

I am going through a craze on gradient colours background at this moment. If you prefer one colour background, get rid of the linear-gradient() function and replace the value with your preferred colour.
